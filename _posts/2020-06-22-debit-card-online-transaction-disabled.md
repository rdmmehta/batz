Wondering why your debit card not working for International or Online transaction?
Well as a security feature from RBI all debit/credit cards which have not been used for online and international transaction will be disabled for these two facilities.
RBI made it clear in its circular dated 15 january <a href="https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11788&Mode=0">Link</a>

Apart from this all Debit/Credit Cards which will be issued after said date will also be issued with these faciities disabled.
Accoun holders can enable these facilities using the internet banking of their bank, ATM and other various channels.

<u>For Punjab National Bank account holders Bank has provided 2 ways to enable this option.</u>
  
 1. Using ATM
