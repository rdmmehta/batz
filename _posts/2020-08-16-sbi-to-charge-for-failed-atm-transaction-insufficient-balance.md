State Bank of India announced that they will start charging for failed ATM transactions due to insufficient balance in the account.

So, account holders need to make sure they have enough balance in their account before they do any transaction.

SBI will charge Rs20/- + GST for every failed transaction.

Do keep these charges in mind before you use your card knowing there's not enough balance in your account.
