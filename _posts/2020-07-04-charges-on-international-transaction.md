In this era of digital payment methods international transactions just feel like any other domestic transaction. But these International transactions involves some charges. 
Whenever we do any International transaction from our debit or credit card we are charged more than the actual exchange rate of thatg currency. 
These charges include Cross Currency Markup Fee and GST on this fee. Most of the cards are charged 3.50% markup fee and 18% GST on this fee. 

Lets say, 1USD= INR70/- and person named "Alpha" wants to buy USD100/- 
From looking at the price we will assume Alpha has to pay INR7000/- But he is charged Rs7289.10/- 
What actually happens here is 3.5% markup fee is charged on Rs70/- 
Markup Fee= Rs2.45/- (a)
GST On Fee @18%= 0.441/- (b)

So final price of 1 USD = 72.8910/-

For USD100 he will pay 72.8910 x 100 = 7289.10/-
