Reserve Bank of India issued guidelines that online webistes will not be able to save credit/debit card details of users.

Users now won't be able to save their card details on any website and will have to inpur it everytime they need to use it. 
So it means you will have to keep your cards handy all the time or memorise them.

Earlier we used to save our card details on websites which we frequently use and just input CVV in future use.

Online retailers are opposing this move of RBI as it will definitely affect user experience on their websites.

I remeber my main credit card details and wil suggest you to do the same ;)
