Banks interest rates on Fixed Deposit has fallen below the Saving Account Interest rates.

With banks now giving less interest on Fixed Deposit for short term than Saving account interest we will be heading towards the era of no interest.
A comparison of interest rates of leading banks has been shown in the photo above.

Banks like PNB, HDFC and Kotak Mahindra give less interest in Fixed Deposit for period of 7days. Whereas banks like SBI, ICICI offer slightly more but less than these banks.

But this move will definitely be beneficial for lenders, as it will also result in reduced interest rates for lenders.
