These revised PSL guidelines will enable better credit penetration to credit defecient areas. Small and marginal farmers and weaker section to benefit from this.

Renewal energy and health infrastructure will also see a credit boost.

RBI has included some fresh categories in Priority Sector Lending. These include loans to farmers for installation of solar power plants and loans for setting up of Compressed Bio Gas Plant. Startups can have bank finance upto Rs50cr.

>To address regional disparities in the flow of priority sector credit, higher weightage have been assigned to incremental priority sector credit in ‘identified districts’ where priority sector credit flow is comparatively low.
>
>The targets prescribed for “small and marginal farmers” and “weaker sections” are being increased in a phased manner.
>
>Higher credit limit has been specified for Farmers Producers Organisations (FPOs)/Farmers Producers Companies (FPCs) undertaking farming with assured marketing of their produce at a pre-determined price.
