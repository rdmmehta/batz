Do we get the mentioned interest rate on premature FDR closure?

Many people are not aware about the interest rate applicable on premature.
Some think that they will get the same interest rate mentioned on Fixed Deposit Receipt and some are only aware about the 1% penalty on premature closure.


Let us see the actual story behind it.

So let us assume there is a guy named Apple(not your iPhone one :P) and he wishes to withdraw his Rs100,000/- FDR before maturity. The FDR says that he is supposed to get 10% interest on its maturity.
But when he checked his balance on completion of the closure procedure he got uneasy on checking his balance. He inquired about it with the banker sitting on the counter but he simply didn't understood any word. And came back home in a lousy mood.
Later he went to one of his banker friend(Orange) to understand what has happened to him. He wanted to share with his friend that his bank has looted him and made a fool out of him.
He told Orange all his misery and his friend assured him that he got the right amount that he was to get.

Orange's explanation:
Your Rs100,000/- FDR is supposed to get 10% interest on maturity, which is 1 year.
But you are going to withdraw it after 7 months and the 6month-1year rate of interest is 7%.
You're eligible for 7% interest here and 1% penalty for premature closure.
So your overall interest rate will fall to 6%

100000*(6/100)*(7/12)

You will get Rs3500/- instead of Rs10,000/- which you would have got on maturity.

(6/100) is the percentage of interest you will actually get.

(7/12) the interest 6% is for 1year but you are withdrawing it after 7 months, so you'll get interest for 7months.

So after understanding the whole concept Apple thought to him that I should have invested wisely, as per my need. Should have invested for 6months because of need of funds after 7months.

Moral of the story is: Before getting a Fixed Deposit do think about when you will be needing the money. So that you don't have to have a far less interest and suffer for premature closure penalties.

If you still have any query, comment below.


Note: Fixed Deposit in bank is safest investment.
