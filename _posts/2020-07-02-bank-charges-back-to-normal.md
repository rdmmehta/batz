The charges which were waived off by Banks on the announcement of FM Nirmala Sitharaman are now being rolled back from July 1.
The following charges will now be applicable:

<b><u>ATM Transaction Charges</u></b>

As banks offer few free transactions on ATMs but due to COVID19 these charges were waived off till June 30. Now from July 1st banks will start charging after the limited free transactions. Refer to your bank's website for the free transactions.

<b><u>Quarterly Average Balance</u></b>

Apart from the ATM charges, QAB charges were also waived off but now your bank will charge you for that too. 
You need to maintain the average balance in your account to avoid these charges. Like in HDFC Bank you need to maintain Rs10000/- in metro branches and Rs5000/- in Rural Branches. 
In PNB you need to maintain Rs2000/- in Urban and Rs1000/- in rural branches,
