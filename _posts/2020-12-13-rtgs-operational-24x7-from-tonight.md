RBI Governor announced that RTGS facility to be made available 24x7 from 12:30am 14th December.
To push digital transactions, Reserve Bank of India has made Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) operational 24x7.

This move will be very beneficial for businesses as they won't have to do NEFT and wait for it to settle, which RBI made 24x7 earlier.

With this move of RBI, we really are moving towards digital India.
