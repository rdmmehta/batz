Losing your debit or credit card should never be taken lightly. But most of us are take it lightly and just ignore the fact that anyone can misuse it.

I've seen many people who don't even bother blocking their debit card when it is lost. Although it can be done in few easy steps.

  1. Visiting your Branch and giving a written letter to block card.

  2. Calling customer care to block it.

The new card can be applied in the branch by giving a request letter. Bank can charge for duplicate card issue.
Most of the people get new card issued without blocking previous card and end up being charged for both cards.

So, you need to block your lost card for two reasons: 1. Safety of your account, 2. To avoid being charged for lost card.
