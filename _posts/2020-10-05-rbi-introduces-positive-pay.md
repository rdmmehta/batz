Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announces introduction of Positive Pay System for Cheque Truncation System (CTS).

Under this process, the issuer of the cheque will submit electronically, through channels like SMS, mobile app, internet banking, ATM, etc., 
certain minimum details of that cheque (like date, name of the beneficiary/payee, amount, etc.) to the drawee bank, details of which are cross 
checked with the presented cheque by CTS. So, whenever a customer will issue a cheque CTS will cross check it with the central server and will only 
make the payment if all the details match.

Usually when a fradulent transaction happens it is not easy to find whose fault it was. Positive Pay will deniftely prove to be helpful to clear out such issues.

National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) shall develop the facility of Positive Pay in CTS and make it available to participant banks. 
Banks shall enable it for all account holders issuing cheques for amounts of ₹50,000 and above. While availing of this facility is at the 
discretion of the account holder, banks may consider making it mandatory in case of cheques for amounts of ₹5,00,000 and above.

RBI has also instructed banks to make their customers aware about this process through SMS, ATM and display messages in branches. 

Positive Pay System shall be implemented from January 01, 2021.

If you want our say on this then do opt for this facility as it will add an extra layer of security to your account and will be helpful in avoiding some kind of banking fraud.
