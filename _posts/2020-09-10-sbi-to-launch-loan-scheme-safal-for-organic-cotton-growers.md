India's largest bank State Bank of India is planning to launch loan product **SAFAL**, scheme which will focus on organic cotton growers.


**Safe and Fast Agriculture Loan (SAFAL)** is focussed on organic cotton growers who don't have any credit history.


"We want to go beyond this so-called retail segment and reach out to, like farmers. Today I am not only giving crop loans, 
We are about to launch a product called Safe and Fast Agriculture Loan (SAFAL). There is a company which brought all the 
organic cotton growers and created a database on the basis of blockchain," SBI MD Setty said.
